# Features

- Curses-like dashboard.
- Remoting monitor / web control.
- All the heartbeats (no matter **monitor** or **tail (logs)**) are automatic destroyed.
- The `PM2` processes are watched by a subscribed emitter.
- Communicated with `PM2` through **RPC** socket directly.
- Socket.io between client and server.
- Monitor CPU and Memory usage of server in a real-time.
- Monitor `PM2` processes in a real-time.
- PM2 _restart/stop/delete_.
- _stopWatch_ files before _restart/stop/delete_.
- _restartWatch_ files before _restart_.
- Supports [ANSI color codes](#ss_logs) by [ansi-html](https://github.com/techtocore/ansi-html).
- High performance. In my case, there are near one hundred processes, but `pm2-gui` works without any suck.

# Cautions

- Web Interface is wrote by CSS3 && HTML5, so view it with the latest version of the browser (WebGL, Animation, WebSocket supports), e.g. Chrome, Safari and Firefox.
- I've never test it on Internet Explorer / Windows.
